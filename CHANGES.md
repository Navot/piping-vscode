# Python Integration Improvements

This PR enhances the Python integration in the Piping extension with the following improvements:

## Core Python Detection

- Added robust Python path detection that:
  - First checks VS Code Python extension settings
  - Falls back to searching PATH for Python installations
  - Validates found Python installations
  - Provides clear error messages when Python is not found

## Better pip Handling

- Enhanced pip command execution that:
  - Uses the correct pip for virtual environments
  - Falls back to `python -m pip` when needed
  - Properly supports Windows and Unix platforms
  - Handles command execution with appropriate error handling
  - Logs all operations to the output channel for debugging

## Dashboard Improvements

- Added package data caching mechanism:
  - Prevents unnecessary package reloading when switching windows
  - Shows the last update timestamp for package data
  - Automatically refreshes data when needed (15-minute cache timeout)
  - Forces refresh after package installations, updates, or removals
  - Improves overall dashboard performance and responsiveness

## Other Improvements

- All operations now log to a dedicated output channel for better debugging
- Improved error handling throughout the codebase
- Better cross-platform support

These improvements make the extension functional and robust across different Python installations and platforms.
