# Python Integration Improvements

This PR enhances the Python integration in the Piping extension with the following improvements:

## Core Python Detection

- Added robust Python path detection that:
  - First checks VS Code Python extension settings
  - Falls back to searching PATH for Python installations
  - Validates found Python installations
  - Provides clear error messages when Python is not found

## Better pip Handling

- Enhanced pip command execution that:
  - Uses the correct pip for virtual environments
  - Falls back to `python -m pip` when needed
  - Properly supports Windows and Unix platforms
  - Handles command execution with appropriate error handling
  - Logs all operations to the output channel for debugging

## Package Management

- Improved package listing with:
  - Description metadata retrieval
  - Better update detection
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Package Search

- Created a PyPI-compatible search functionality that:
  - Uses a custom Python script to query PyPI API
  - Falls back to local package list search if PyPI search fails
  - Provides rich package information including descriptions

## Virtual Environment Management

- Enhanced virtual environment detection:
  - Finds environments in multiple standard locations
  - Validates environments properly
  - Handles virtual environment creation with better error reporting

## Other Improvements

- All operations now log to a dedicated output channel for better debugging
- Improved error handling throughout the codebase
- Better cross-platform support

These improvements make the extension functional and robust across different Python installations and platforms.
